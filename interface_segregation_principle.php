 * Interface Segregation Principle:

 * A client should never be forced to implement an interface that it doesn’t use, 
 * or clients shouldn’t be forced to depend on methods they do not use.
 * Still building from the previous ShapeInterface example, 
 * you will need to support the new three-dimensional shapes of Cuboid and Spheroid, 
 * and these shapes will need to also calculate volume.
 * Let’s consider what would happen if you were to modify the ShapeInterface to add another contract:

 * Instead, you could create another interface called ThreeDimensionalShapeInterface
